# Pixema

[Website](https://leta1603.github.io/Pixema/)

Pixema is a web application similar to kinopoisk.ru and okko.tv, providing a vast collection of movies and TV shows. It allows users to search for content, add items to their favorites, and explore the current trending movies and series. The application supports both light and dark themes. The local storage was used due to the fact that at the time of the creation of the application there was no place to store information. Each user has their own list of favorite movies.
